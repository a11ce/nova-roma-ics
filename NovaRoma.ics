SUMMARY:Matronalia
DESCRIPTION:The Matronalia\, held on New Year's Day\, is sacred to Juno 
 Lucina\, who presides over women and childbirth in particular. When 
 engaged in her worship\, women had to unbind their hair and have nothing 
 knotted on their person\, to symbolize nothing hindering safe childbirth. 
 It is a day of renewal\, as the sacred fire of Vesta is tended by the 
 Vestal Virgins.\n\nOn the Matronalia it is customary for husbands to pray 
 for the wellbeing and health of their wives. It is a day of great 
 celebration and revelry\, when gifts are exchanged between friends and 
 family members. It is a day of feasting\, gambling\, and music\, with 
 much dancing in the streets.

SUMMARY:Liberalia
DESCRIPTION:The celebration of Liber Pater\, an old Italian god of both 
 fertility and wine. He is associated with the Greek Dionysus. Old women\, 
 acting as priestesses of Liber Pater\, wear ivy weaths and displaying 
 cakes (libia) made of oil and honey. They would sacrifice these cakes to 
 Liber Pater for the passersby. A later development included the goddess 
 Libera (as a counterpart to the male Liber)\; the two split jurisdiction 
 over the female and male seed respectively. A rustic ceremony\, a large 
 phallus was carted around the countryside to encourage fertility and 
 protect the crops from evil\, after which a wreath was placed upon it by 
 a virtuous matron.
